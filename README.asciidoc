== cgh-groovy-ast

A small project containing custom Groovy AST transformations. 
This allows classes to be decorated with methods at runtime 
through the use of Annotations.


=== Currently Supported AST Transformations.

==== Validatable

 - @net.cghsystems.groocy.transform.Validatable

   THis Groovy AST annotation will decorate all target objects with an isValid method. When
   called this will return a boolean value to determine if the target isValid. An object is 
   determined to be valid if all of its fields are set.
